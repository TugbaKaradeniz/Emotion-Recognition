# Emotion-Recognition
This project creates a classification model in Deep Learning Algorithm CNN capable 
of recognizing human facial emotions.

## Getting Started

This project uses the CK+ dataset containing 8 classes of facial expressions encoded as
{0=neutral, 1=anger, 2=contempt, 3=disgust, 4=fear, 5=happy, 6=sadness, 7=surprise}.

### Prerequisites

1. [CK+ dataset](http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/) - The dataset used
2. Python 3.0
3. OpenCV 3

### Installing

Clone the repository
```
Download the CK+ dataset in "data" folder.

Install OpenCV 3
```
conda install -c menpo opencv3=3.2.0
```
